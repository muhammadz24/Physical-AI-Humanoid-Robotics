# Chapter 5: Vision-Language-Action Systems

## Chapter Overview

Welcome to the frontier of Physical AI: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that enable robots to understand natural language instructions, perceive their environment visually, and execute complex manipulation tasks. This chapter explores how modern AI systems combine computer vision, language understanding, and robotic control to create generalist robots capable of performing diverse tasks from simple verbal commands.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand VLA model architecture and how it unifies perception, language, and action
- Learn about RT-1 and RT-2 models from Google DeepMind
- Explore practical integration patterns for VLA in robot systems
- Build end-to-end pipelines from language instruction to robot action

**Prerequisites:**
- Chapter 3: ROS 2 Fundamentals
- Chapter 4: Digital Twin Simulation
- Basic understanding of machine learning and neural networks
- Familiarity with computer vision concepts

**Estimated Reading Time:** 40-45 minutes
