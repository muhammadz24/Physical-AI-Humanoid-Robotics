# Chapter 2: Basics of Humanoid Robotics

## Chapter Overview

Humanoid robots—machines designed to resemble and move like humans—represent one of the most challenging and fascinating applications of Physical AI. This chapter explores the fundamental components, kinematics, and control strategies that enable bipedal robots to walk, balance, and interact with human-centered environments.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the key components of humanoid robot hardware
- Learn the principles of forward and inverse kinematics
- Grasp the challenges of bipedal locomotion and balance
- Explore control strategies for stable walking

**Prerequisites:**
- Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI
- Basic linear algebra (vectors, matrices, transformations)
- Understanding of physics (forces, torques, Newton's laws)

**Estimated Reading Time:** 30-35 minutes

## Why Humanoid Robots?

Humanoid robots are designed to operate in environments built for humans—climbing stairs, opening doors, using tools. Their human-like form factor enables them to navigate spaces where wheeled robots cannot go and manipulate objects designed for human hands.

**Key Applications**:
- Disaster response (navigating rubble, using human tools)
- Healthcare assistance (patient lifting, mobility support)
- Research platform (studying human motion, developing prosthetics)
- Service roles (hospitality, education, entertainment)
