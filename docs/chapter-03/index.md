# Chapter 3: ROS 2 Fundamentals

## Chapter Overview

Welcome to ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the industry-standard middleware for building sophisticated robot systems. This chapter introduces you to the architecture, communication patterns, and core concepts that make ROS 2 the foundation for modern robotics development.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand ROS 2 architecture and its advantages over ROS 1
- Master nodes, topics, and publish-subscribe communication
- Learn services and actions for request-response patterns
- Build functional ROS 2 applications with Python and C++

**Prerequisites:**
- Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI
- Chapter 2: Basics of Humanoid Robotics
- Python programming fundamentals
- Linux command-line basics (recommended)

**Estimated Reading Time:** 35-40 minutes
